## Introduction
Hi! I'm Addy!

Just a student, a worker, and a Linux Enthusiast. I love metal, cat, linux, playing guitar, design,
customizing desktop, more metal, reading, climbing mountain, fishing, watching movie, anime, and
even more metal. I write articles in this blog when I have some freetime and not lazy. I write
some knowledges I have about Linux, and probably I will also expand the theme of this blog with
my adventures in my life. I hope this blog will be useful for everyone. This "about me" page is
just filled with my boring profile.

By the way, my favourite band is Dream Theater. My favourite GNU/Linux distro is Debian. My
favourite movie director is Christopher Nolan. My favourite book is A Study in Scarlet. My
favourite anime is Fullmetal Alchemist. My favourite album is Metropolis Part 2 : Scenes from a
Memory. My favourite window manager is Openbox. And my favourite food is Sate Kambing.
